# Hi, I'm Chibuike Adieze 👋👋



### A little about me
I am passionate about data insights and how to convert it to be useful to others. I like to think of myself as a technology generalist and an outcome-oriented individual. This means that although I am passionate about Machine learning solutions, I am not loyal to just one method/tools of solving a machine learning problem. It greatly depends on the problem requirement and what makes more sense. This is why I currently have a growing interesting in learning to use AWS to integrate to some of project goals.



For the sake of emphasis, 🐍Python, R and SQL are my preferred language.

Some of the tools I am frequently use are:

Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Spacy)
Other tools (Visual studio, Github, Tableau, Jupyterlab)
Other tools I am familiar with but still working on are
AWS, Docker, Terraform.

📫  Apart from my Github profile, you can also contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chibuike-adieze). I am always up for a challenge😀
